Quick and Easy Mock Shrimp "Risotto"

Yield:
1 Serving

Per serving:
1 Lean
3 Greens
3 Condiments
2 Healthy Fats

Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup cooked, grated cauliflower
7 oz peeled, tails removed, cooked shrimp
1 tbsp Land O' Lakes light butter spread with canola oil
2 light garlic and herb Laughing Cow Cheese wedges
1 garlic clove, chopped
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes
2 tsp grated Kraft Parmesan Cheese

Preparation:
Cook cauliflower. I used frozen cauliflower. Follow the cooking instructions on the back of the package. Drain.
Use a food scale to measure out 270 grams of cauliflower, since 90 grams of cooked from frozen is 1 Green. If you are cooking fresh cauliflower, measure out 186 grams, since 62 grams of cooked from fresh is 1 Green. Place cooked cauliflower in a food processor and shred using the shredding disk. Place in a medium-sized bowl and set aside.
Thaw out cooked shrimp from the bag. Peel and remove tails if necessary. Weigh out 7 oz of shrimp and set aside.

Directions:
In a medium-sized skillet, melt butter and add garlic. Saute garlic in butter until they turn light brown, a few minutes over medium-high heat. Lower the temperature to medium heat and add the wedges of laughing cow cheese. Stir until slightly melted. It is okay to have some lumps. They will blend nicely with the rest of the ingredients. Add the shrimp to the laughing cow cheese mixture and then add the grated cauliflower, parmesan cheese, and salt. Stir until combined. Heat for about 3 to 4 minutes or until heated thoroughly. Sprinkle parsley flakes on top. Enjoy!
