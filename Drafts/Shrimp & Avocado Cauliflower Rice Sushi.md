Shrimp & Avocado Cauliflower Rice Sushi

Yield:
2 Servings (2 rolls per serving)

Per serving:
1 Leanest
3 Green
2 Healthy Fat
3 Condiments

Ingredients:
2 1/2 cup riced cauliflower
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1/8 tsp zero-calorie sugar substitute
12 oz cooked and peeled shrimp, finely chopped
1/3 cup low-fat, plain greek yogurt
2 tsp sriracha
1/2 medium avocado, cut into 8 even slices
1/2 medium cucumber, cut lengthwise into 4 even slices
4 sheets nori
1 1/2 tbsp sesame seeds

Directions:
In a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl, microwave cauliflower "rice" for 5 minutes, stirring halfway through
Mix rice vinegar and sugar substitute; set aside.
In a medium-sized bowl, mix chopped shrimp. Greek yogurt, and sriracha; set aside.
Assemble sushi: lay a sheet of nori on a sushi rolling mat and spread one-quarter of the cauliflower rice mixture in an even layer onto the half of the sheet closest to you (cover only half of the sheet, and leave a one-inch rim around the other sides of the cauliflower) Add the fillings ( one sliced cucumber, two slices avocado, and one quarter shrimp mixture per roll), placing them horizontally on the cauliflower rice, and leaving some rice exposed both behind and in front of them. Roll the sushi by folding the side of exposed nori closest to you over the filling, tucking all of the fillings into the first complete roll. Continue rolling until you get to the end of the nori sheet.
Repeat with remaining nori sheets, cauliflower rice, and fillings (you should end up with four rolls).
Slice rolls into pieces using a clean, sharp knife.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and enjoy!
