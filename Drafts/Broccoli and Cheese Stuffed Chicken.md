Chop broccoli into small pieces
Wrap chicken breasts in plastic wrap and pound to less than 1/2 inch thickness with a meat-mallet
Sprinkle both sides of chicken with Mrs Dash, then turn so the "inside" is up.
Spread each breast with 1 Tbsp fat-free cream cheese
Sprinkle each breast with 1 Tbsp sharp-cheddar
Divide the broccoli & tomatoes among the breasts
Carefully roll up each breast, beginning with wide end, pressing filling in as needed
Use toothpicks to hold breasts in place
