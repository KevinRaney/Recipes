# Chicken Cacciatore and Spaghetti Squash

Chicken Cacciatore and Spaghetti Squash
Makes 6 servings
Per serving
½ protein serving
3 vegetables
2 2/3 condiments
Ingredients:
4 ½ cups cooked Spaghetti Squash
1 ¾ pounds chicken breasts, trimmed of fat and chopped (should be about 14 oz when cooked)
1 ½ cups low-sugar tomato sauce – Rao’s marinara is a good brand
1/2 large, bell pepper, sliced
6 1/3 ounces tomato, sliced
1/4 cup medium red onion, sliced
1 tbsp fresh garlic, pressed
1/8 tsp crushed red pepper
1 tbsp Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cracked pepper
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Season squash with some salt and pepper and lay face down on a PAMmed cookie sheet. Bake in oven for 45 min, or until squash is fork tender and releases easily from the shell.
In the meantime, place chicken pieces, salt, cracked pepper, crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic in a PAMmed pan over med-high heat. Sauté until chicken is cooked on the outside, but slightly underdone on the inside - 8-10 min. Add bell pepper, tomato and red onion and sauté for 3-5 min, until onions are translucent. Add in your tomato sauce and simmer for 15 min on low, stirring occasionally. Sauce will thicken quite a bit. You can let this simmer for longer while you wait on your squash, but don’t let your chicken get rubbery.
Pull squash out of the oven and using a fork, gently scrape the side of the squash from rind to center, creating “spaghetti noodles”. Place spaghetti squash in the center of your plate and scoop chicken and sauce over the top
