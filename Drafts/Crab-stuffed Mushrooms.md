Crab-stuffed Mushrooms 🍄 🦀

Yield:
1 Serving

Per serving: 1/2 leanest | 1/2 lean | 3 green | 
3 condiments

Ingredients:
3.5 oz lump crab meat  (14 oz)
2 oz part-skim mozzarella (8oz)
1 clove garlic, minced (4)
1 Tbsp green onions, finely diced (4 Tbsp)
1 Tbsp red bell pepper, finely diced (4 Tbsp)
1 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese (4 Tbsp)
1/4 tsp ground black pepper (4 Tbsp)
1/4 tsp dried dill weed (4Tbsp)
1 1/4 cups mushroom caps 

Directions: 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Remove stems from mushrooms and wash and dry the caps. Place stem-side up in a rectangular glass dish that has been sprayed with PAM.

In a small bowl, combine crab meat, mozzarella, garlic, green onions, bell pepper, black pepper, and dill weed in a small bowl. Stir gently to combine, trying to avoid breaking up the lumps of crab as much as possible. Fill the mushroom caps with the mixture, pressing it firmly into the caps, and mounding it on top. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the stuffed mushrooms. Bake for 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned and the cheese has melted.
