Sloppy Joes with Revolution Rolls

Yield:
3 servings

Per serving:
1 Lean
3 Condiments

Ingredients:
For the beef:
8.75 oz 93% lean ground beef, cooked and drained of fat
1/4 cup reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese Or use 10 oz of lean ground beef if omitting the cheese

For the sauce:
3 tbsp reduced sugar ketchup
1 tbsp yellow mustard
1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 tbsp Walden Farms pancake syrup
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/8 tsp salt

For the rolls:
3 eggs at room temp
3 Tbsp light cream cheese at room temp
Pinch cream of tartar, white vinegar or lemon juice
1 packet Splenda (optional) - we did not use this in ours

Instructions:
For the beef:
Brown ground beef in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.
Drain fat and measure out 8.75 oz. Return to skillet. Save the rest for another use.

For the sauce:
Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Pour sauce over ground beef. Heat skillet over low heat. Stir until combined. Continue cooking for 4 to 5 min or until heated thoroughly stirring often.

For the Rolls:
Preheat oven to 350°
Separate egg whites yolks, putting whites in one bowl, yolks in another.
Add cream of tartar to whites. Beat on high until glossy, smooth, and just form stiff peaks. Set aside.
Add cream cheese and Splenda (if using) to yolks. Whisk the mixture until smooth and well blended.
Add some of the whites to the yolks to lighten them.
Then gently fold yolk mixture back into the whites, being careful to not over mix and make whites fall.
On a cookie sheet lined w/parchment, make six equal-sized blobs, not touching.
Bake at 350°, 25-35 minutes.
