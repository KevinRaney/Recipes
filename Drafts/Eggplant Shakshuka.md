Makes 4 servings
Each serving provides
2 green
1 healthy fat
3 condiments
1 ounce lean

1. 3 cups diced eggplant
2. 4 teaspoons olive oil
3. 3 cloves garlic
4. 2 tsp ground cumin
5. 1 tsp smoked paprika
6. 1.5 tsp cinnamon
7. pinch cayenne pepper
8. 1 cup diced tomatoes
9. 4 eggs
10. 1 cup Greek basil leaves, torn basil leaves, or chopped parsley

Instructions
Cut the eggplant into 1cm dice. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or skillet and saute the eggplant pieces for a few minutes until the soften and begin to colour.
Peel and crush the garlic and add to the eggplant with the cumin, paprika cinnamon and cayenne. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes until the spices are toasted and fragrant.
Add the canned tomatoes, stir well, and break up the tomatoes with a spoon. If the sauce seems very thick, add a splash of water to thin down slightly.
Cook the sauce for around 15 minutes until the tomatoes are cooked and the sauce has darkened. Make four indentations in the sauce with the back of a spoon, and crack an egg into each one.
Cover the pan and continue to cook for another 4-6 minutes until the egg whites are cooked - the yolks should still be soft.
Scatter over the basil/parsley and serve
