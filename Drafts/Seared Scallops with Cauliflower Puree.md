## Cauliflower Puree
## 

### Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup cooked cauliflower 
* 2 Light Laughing Cow Cheese Wedges 
* 1/16 tsp (half of 1/8 tsp) Salt 
* 1/8 tsp pepper 

### Directions
1. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
2. Cut the cauliflower into small florets and add to the boiling water for 10 minutes or until it’s soft when you poke with a fork. 
3. Drain the cauliflower. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and use a hand mixer and mix until creamy. You can also use a food processor for this, which is my preference. 
4. Put puree back in the pot over low heat to keep warm.

## Scallops
### 

### Ingredients
* 9 oz. dry scallops 
* 1/8 tsp Lemon pepper 
* 1/8 tsp Coriander 
* 1 teaspoon olive oil 
* 1/2 tsp fresh chopped chives or scallions, thinly sliced 

### Directions

1. Rinse, then pat the scallops dry. 
2. Combine lemon pepper, coriander and salt. Sprinkle both sides of scallops with seasoning blend. 
3. Place olive oil in a non-stick skillet, heat over high heat until sizzling then add the scallops. Sear until nicely browned on one side, flip and cook on the other side. Touch them to gauge their level of doneness; they need to have a little give but not too much, take care not to overcook to where they’re hard to the touch. Remove to a plate, cover.
4. Spoon Cauliflower puree onto plate and place scallops on top. Sprinkle sliced chives and serve.
