Teriyaki Salmon Bites

Yield: 

2 Serving

Per Serving

1 Lean
1/8 Green
2.75 Condiments
¾ Healthy Fat

Ingredients:

20 oz. of Salmon Fillets raw or 7 oz. cooked 
¼ C. Scallions cut or 1.76 oz. 
3 Tbsp. Low Sodium Soy Sauce 
2 Tsp Fresh Ginger Root grated 
½ Tsp. Red Pepper Flakes 
1 Tsp. Garlic Powder 
½ Tbsp. Sesame Seeds 
1 Tsp. Olive Oil 

Directions:

Cut Salmon into bite-size pieces, about 1” each and set aside.
In a large bowl add the soy sauce, ginger root, red pepper flakes, garlic, olive oil and mix well.
Add the salmon bites into the bowl with the marinade, cover, and let it sit for 10-15 minutes.
In a large skillet over medium heat add the marinade, and arrange the salmon pieces into a single layer and cook in the sauce for a couple of minutes on that side until that side is crispy (2-3 min). Carefully flip the salmon bites and continue to cook until salmon bites form a thin crust and that other side, about 2-3 more minutes (don’t fuss too much with them or they will break apart).
Serve on a platter and drizzle the leftover sauce (if any). Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
Enjoy!!!
