# Steak and Zucchini Horseradish Alfredo

Steak and Zucchini Horseradish Alfredo

6 cups zucchini noodles (about 2 large zucchinis)
1½ lbs raw skirt steak, thinly sliced
¼ cup chicken or vegetable broth
½ tsp potato starch
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
2 tsp horseradish
1 tsp garlic powder
½ tsp soy sauce
¼ tsp each- salt & pepper

Directions 
1. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat for 4-5 minutes. You want the pan to be really hot before you add the steak. 
Coat the steak with pam and sprinkle with lots of salt and pepper then add the steaks to the hot pan.
You want to hear a sizzle when the steaks touch the pan. Cook for 2 minutes, flip then cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the steaks from the pan and set them aside to rest.

2. Lower the heat to medium and spray pan with pam.

3. In a separate bowl, stir together the stock and potato starch and add the mixture to the pan. Whisk the stock and scrape up any steak bits in the bottom of the pan. The mixture thickens for around 1 minute then add the coconut milk, horseradish, garlic powder, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Let the sauce thicken for around 10 minutes, whisking occasionally.

4. While the sauce is thickening, prepare the zucchini noodles. Using a julienne peeler or a very sharp knife, peel the zucchini to create noodle shaped slices. When you get to the seeds of the zucchini, stop peeling. OR use a ZOODLER OR buy pre-noodled zucchini in the produce section. 

5. When the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, add the zucchini noodles. Combine the sauce and the zucchini noodles and cook the mixture for another 2 minutes, just to lightly cook the zucchini. Place the noodles on a plate and top with slices of the steak.
