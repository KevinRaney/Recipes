1 cup no sugar added Marinara Sauce, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tbsp Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped
1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1 1/2 tsp onion powder
3/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
For the filling and the topping

1 ½ cup mozzarella cheese, shredded, divided
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, shredded, divided
2 tbsp Italian flat leaf parsley, chopped
2 tsp chives, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced

Instructions
Preheat oven to 400°
In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, 1/4 cup of marinara sauce, garlic, parsley, Italian seasoning, onion powder, sea salt and black pepper. Divide the mixture into 2 equal portions.
In a separate mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, chives, garlic and sea salt. Mix until all ingredients are combined.
Put half of the meat mixture into the bottom of a 9.25 x 5.25 x 2 3/4 loaf pan. Press evenly into the pan, reaching all the way to the corners.
Make a groove down the center of the meat. Layer the cheese filling down the center.
Top with the second half of the meat mixture, spreading evenly across the pan and pressing down into the bottom layer. Bake for 20 minutes.
Remove the meatloaf from the oven and top with 1/4 cup of marinara sauce and remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Return to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
After slicing the meatloaf, top each slice with the remaining marinara sauce.
This pairs nicely with spaghetti squash for more of your veggies!
