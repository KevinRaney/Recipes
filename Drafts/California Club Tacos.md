California Club Tacos 
1 Serving: 1 leaner | 3 greens | 1 healthy fat | 1 condiment

Ingredients:
• 3 oz grilled chicken breast, chopped (.5 leaner)
• 1 oz cooked (turkey) bacon, diced (.2 lean)
• 1/4 oz avocado, diced (1/2 healthy fat)
• 1 TBSP reduced fat ranch (1/2 healthy fat)
• ½ cup (2.63 oz) red ripe diced tomatoes (1 green)
• 2 cups (3.32 oz) chopped romaine lettuce (2 greens)
• 1/3 cup (~1.2 oz) 2% milk provolone slices (.3 lean)
• 10 1/4 sec sprays of cooking spray (1 condiment)

Instructions:
To make the provolone taco shells: Place 1 slice of provolone cheese on a paper plate (must be coated or leakproof) greased with cooking spray. Microwave on high for 60 seconds

Remove from microwave immediately and, if necessary, reform cheese into a circle. Wait 5
seconds for the cheese to cool and then form into a taco shell shape on the edge of a dish or
skinny rolling pin. Let cool until set. Repeat for the remaining 2 slices of cheese.

To make the filling: Toss the chicken, avocado, bacon, tomatoes, ranch, and lettuce to
combine

Fill the cooled taco shells with the lettuce mixture. Serve any extra as a side-salad
