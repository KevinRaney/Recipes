## Ingredients
- 3 cups prepared spaghetti squash (6 greens)
- 1 tablespoons olive oil (3 healthy fats)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (2 condiments)
- 1 cup chopped tomatoes (2 greens)
- 1/2 cup chopped zucchini (1 green)
- 3/4 cup crumbled reduced fat feta cheese (3/4 Lean)
- 1 teaspoon basil (1 condiment)

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
2. Place spaghetti squash cut sides down on the prepared baking sheet, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a sharp knife can be inserted with only a little resistance.
3. Remove squash from oven, and set aside to cool enough to be easily handled.
4. Use a large spoon to scoop the stringy pulp from the squash and set aside 3 cups. Save the rest for later.
5. Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic in oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Stir in the tomatoes, zucchini, and cook only until warm.
7. Toss squash with the sauteed vegetables, feta cheese, and basil. Serve warm.

3 Servings: Each serving has 1 Complete Green, 1/4 Lean, 1 Condiment and 1 Healthy Fat
