Makes 3 servings

Each serving with 1 lean, 3 greens, 1 healthy fat and 3 condiments

# INGREDIENTS
4 zucchini, halved lengthwise (about 16 oz 8 greens)
1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 tsp Kosher salt
1/2 tsp Freshly ground black pepper
6 wedges light laughing cow cream cheese, softened
5 oz cooked shredded chicken
4 oz. shredded low fat Monterey jack , divided
1 c shredded 2% cheddar cheese, divided
1 ounce extra lean turkey bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/2 c jalapeños, seeds removed and diced
1/2 tsp. garlic powder

# DIRECTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 350°.
2. Score zucchini (like you’re dicing an avocado) and scoop out insides, reserving them for later. Place zucchini halves cut side-up into bottom of 9”-x-13” baking dish and drizzle with oil. Bake until zucchini turns bright green and is just beginning to soften, 15 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine laughing cow, shredded chicken, ½ of each cheese, turkey bacon, jalapeños, and garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper. Fold in reserved zucchini pieces.
Spoon filling into zucchini and top with remaining ½ of each cheese and bake until cheese is melty, 15 minutes.
