# Sour Cream Beef Bake

Sour Cream Beef Bake
Makes 6 servings

Per serving
1 Lean
3 Green
2 Condiments

5 cups cauliflower rice
15 ounces cooked 85-94% lean ground beef
2 Cups Rao's marinara sauce
1/2 Cup sour cream
1 1/2 Cup 1% cottage cheese
2 Cups reduced fat shredded cheese
1/2 Cup green onion
1/2 Teaspoon salt
1 Teaspoon pepper

Preheat oven to 350.
Place the cauliflower rice in a 2.5-quart baking dish. Microwave 4-5 minutes or until tender but not mushy. 
After cooking, set aside (leave in the casserole dish).
In a large skillet or pot, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until browned, 7-10 minutes. 
Drain and stir in the tomato sauce, salt, and pepper.
In a mixing bowl, stir together the cottage cheese and sour cream. Mix in the sliced green onions.
Pour the sour cream mixture into the cauliflower rice (thatâ€™s in the casserole dish) and mix well.
Pour half of the beef mixture over the cauliflower rice mixture. 
Spread with the back of a spoon to even. Top with 1 cup of the cheddar cheese. 
Repeat with the remaining beef mixture and cheese, ending with the cheese.

Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
