Per serving:

1 Lean
3 Green
1 Condiment.

Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups (5.28 oz) cauliflower
1/4 cup (2.15 oz) egg beaters
1/2 cup (4 oz) 2% cottage cheese
1/2 cup (2 oz) 2% skim shredded cheddar cheese (3-6 grams fat/oz)
1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper

Directions:

If using fresh cauliflower, you don't need to cook the cauliflower first. If using frozen, cook the cauliflower in a microwave-safe dish according to the directions on the bag.
Chop the cauliflower into pieces about the size of pasta or pulse in the food processor. Mix with egg beaters, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese, and cayenne pepper.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes.
