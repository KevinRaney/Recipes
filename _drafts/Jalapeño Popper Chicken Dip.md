Jalapeño Popper Chicken Dip

Makes 4 servings, per serving you enjoy:
1 Lean | 1.75 Condiments | 1 Healthy Fat

Ingredients:
12 ounces cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts, shredded (2 Leans)
3/4 cup Fage 2% plain Greek yogurt (1/2 Lean)
1/4 cup regular cream cheese (4 Healthy Fats)
5 slices turkey bacon cooked and crumbled (1/2 Lean)
3 ounces canned jalapenos, diced (3 Condiments)
1/2 tsp garlic powder (1 Condiment)
1/2 tsp onion powder (1 Condiment)
2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese (2 Condiments)
1 cup shredded 2% sharp cheddar cheese, divided (1 Lean)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine shredded chicken, yogurt, and cream cheese in a medium-sized bowl. Add crumbled turkey bacon, diced jalapenos, garlic powder, onion powder, Parmesan cheese, and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese. Stir until everything is combined. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Bake for 20 minutes or until cheese has melted. NOTE: I serve mine with thickly sliced bell peppers as a “dipper” and count them toward my Green serving. It’s a scoop for goodness without the unnecessary “fluff”.
