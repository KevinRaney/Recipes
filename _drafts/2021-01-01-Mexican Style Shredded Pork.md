Mexican Style Shredded Pork

Ingredients:
2 lb pork loin roast (4 Leans)
1/2 tsp salt (2 Condiments)
1/4 tsp pepper (1/2 Condiment)
1/4 tsp garlic powder (1 Condiment)
1/2 tsp chili powder - optional (1/2 Condiment)
2 - 4 oz cans of green chilies (2 Greens)
1/4 cup chipotle salsa (4 Condiments)
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Rinse pork loin and pat dry with a paper towel. Trim it of all visible fat (mine did not have much at all). Season with salt, pepper, chili powder and garlic powder on all sides. Place in the slow cooker.

Combine green chilies, salsa and water in a small bowl and pour over pork. Cook on LOW for 8 hours. Shred the pork. You may add an additional 1/4 cup of water if desired, to keep the meat from drying out. Cook on LOW for an additional 1 hour.

4 Servings
Lean, 1/2 of 1 Green, and 2 Condiments per serving (No healthy fat required)
