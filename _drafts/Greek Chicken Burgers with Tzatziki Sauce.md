Greek Chicken Burgers with Tzatziki Sauce

Ingredients:

For Tzatziki Sauce:
1 small cucumber
½ Tbsp chopped fresh mint
1 Tbsp chopped fresh dill
½ Tbsp lemon juice
1 clove minced garlic
1 cup plain, low-fat Greek yogurt

For Chicken Burgers:
2 oz reduced-fat feta
1 egg
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
10 chopped and pitted kalamata olives
1 Tbsp cornstarch
1 tsp dried oregano
2 cloves garlic, chopped
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp pepper
1 lb 95-97% lean ground chicken
2 tsp olive oil

2 sliced tomatoes
1 small head iceberg lettuce, cut into eight bun-sized pieces

Directions:
Chop half of the cucumber into small pieces, and place in a small bowl. Slice remaining cucumber into thin slices for sandwiches, and set aside. Add remaining sauce ingredients to small bowl, and refrigerate until ready to use. 
In a large bowl, combine the first nine burger ingredients. Add chicken, and mix lightly but thoroughly. Shape into four burger patties.
Moisten a paper towel with oil, and, using cooking tongs, rub on grill rack to coat lightly. Add burgers, and grill covered, over medium heat, until a meat thermometer reads 165° F (about 5-7 minutes on each side).
Serve on iceberg lettuce “buns” with tomato slices, remaining cucumber, and sauce.
