# Monterey Chicken

Monterey Chicken

Makes 3 servings
Each serving provides:
1 leaner protein
2 condiments

Ingredients:
2-9 ounce chicken breasts, boneless skinless
¼ cup mozzarella cheese
¼ cup Monterey/cheddar blend cheese
4 slices Jennie-O Extra Lean turkey bacon
½ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp onion powder
¼ cup sugar-free BBQ sauce

Directions:
Before we start grilling, cut turkey bacon in medium dice and cook it in a skillet over medium-low heat until crispy. Set aside. Season chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and the dried spices.
Heat grill over high heat for at least 5 minutes. Grease grates, place chicken on grill over medium heat. Let cook until almost done. When the chicken has an internal temperature of 150 degrees, baste with BBQ sauce on both sides and continue cooking until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees. (Don’t baste the chicken as soon as it hits the grill or else the BBQ sauce will burn)
When chicken is cooked through, place half of the turkey bacon on top of each piece.
Mix the cheese together and spread evenly over each piece.
Place the top of the grill down and let the cheese melt, this will only take a couple of minutes.
