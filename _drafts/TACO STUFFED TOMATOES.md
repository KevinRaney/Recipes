## Ingredients:
* ½ cup scallions
* 1 ½ pounds ground beef 
* 1 tablespoon taco seasoning 
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ½ teaspoon pepper 
* 2/3 cup reduced fat Mexican cheese
* 1 cup shredded iceburg lettuce 
* ½ cup low fat plain Greek yogurt
* 4 tomatoes 

## 

## Directions:
1. In a medium skillet over medium heat Add scallions to ground beef and taco seasoning, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper, and cook until the beef is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Drain fat and set aside.
2. Flip tomatoes so they are stem-side down. Cut the tomatoes into six wedges, being careful to not cut completely through the tomato. Carefully spread open the wedges.
3. Divide taco meat evenly among the tomatoes, then top each with cheese, lettuce, and Greek yogurt and serve.
