# Meatball Lasagna

Meatball Lasagna

Per recipe:

1 Lean
3 Greens
2 Condiments
no Healthy Fat required

Ingredients:

6 Market Pantry Lean Turkey Meatballs, cooked (I baked them for 20 minutes) and sliced into fourths (1/2 Lean)
1/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese (1/4 Lean)
1/4 cup 2% reduced-fat Mozzarella Cheese (1/4 Lean)
1 cup or 180 grams (cooked weight) yellow squash or zucchini, sliced lengthwise (2 Greens)
1/2 cup Great Value Italian diced tomatoes, less than 5 g of carbs per 1/2 cup (1 Green)
1/4 tsp garlic salt (1 Condiment)
1/4 tsp dried basil (1/4 Condiment)
2 tsp grated parmesan cheese (2/3 Condiment)

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Layer zucchini or squash slices along the bottom of a medium-sized casserole dish. Spread ricotta cheese over the squash. Sprinkle garlic salt and basil over the ricotta cheese and squash slices. Combine diced tomatoes with meatball pieces in a small bowl. Pour over ricotta cheese. Sprinkle mozzarella over meatballs and then top with grated parmesan cheese. Bake for 25 minutes or until cheese is melted. There will be some water or liquid from the squash or ricotta. This is normal. I just drain it from the casserole dish by tipping the dish slightly to the side while making sure the lasagna doesn't pour out as well.
