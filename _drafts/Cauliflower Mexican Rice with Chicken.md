Cauliflower Mexican Rice with Chicken

Yield:
2 servings

Per serving:
1 Leaner
1 Healthy Fat
3 Greens
3 Condiments

Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups grated cooked cauliflower
1/2 cup mild Rotel diced tomatoes
1/4 cup salsa
1/8 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1 cup reduced-fat Mexican cheese, grated
9 oz chicken breast (should yield 6 oz cooked), cooked and chopped
1/2 tsp low sodium taco seasoning
1 tsp olive oil

Directions:
Season chicken with taco seasoning and toss with olive oil
Marinate for at least 4 hours
Grill, bake, or broil.
Chop chicken into pieces into bite-size pieces. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine grated cauliflower, Rotel tomatoes, salsa, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour into a casserole dish (I used a 9-inch pie plate), layer with chicken and then cover with cheese. Bake in a 350Â°F oven for 25 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Divide into 2 equal portions.
