Green Chile Chicken Soup

Yield: 2 servings
Per serving:
1 Leaner
1/2 Green
1 Healthy fat
3 Condiments

Ingredients:
1/2 cup diced canned green chilies
1 tbsp raw onion
1 tbsp jalapeno pepper, raw
1 tsp oil, olive
6 oz chicken, breast, boneless, skinless
1/2 tsp cumin
5 sprays non-stick cooking spray
1 wedge laughing cow light
queso fresco wedges
1 clove garlic
2 tbsp cilantro
32 fl oz chicken broth

Directions:
Roast a small jalapeno pepper by placing a slit in the side with a knife and spraying with olive oil.
Place under broiler until bubbly and brown on top.
Remove seeds and roughly chop. If you are short on time, skip this step and simply add 1 teaspoon of chopped canned jalapenos.
Heat oil in a medium pan, and add chopped onion and minced garlic. Saute until translucent.
Add broth, pre-cooked chicken breast, cumin, canned green chilies, and jalapeno.
Heat until almost boiling. Remove from the heat.
Add roughly chopped fresh cilantro and the laughing cow cheese wedges.
Pour mixture into a blender and blend until smooth.
