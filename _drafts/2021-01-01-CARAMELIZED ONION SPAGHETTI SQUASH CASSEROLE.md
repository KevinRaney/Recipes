# CARAMELIZED ONION SPAGHETTI SQUASH CASSEROLE

CARAMELIZED ONION SPAGHETTI SQUASH CASSEROLE

Yield:

5 servings

Per serving:

3 vegetables
1 condiment
1 ¼ fat servings
½ ounce protein

Ingredients:

1 medium spaghetti squash – use 2 1/2 cups cooked squash
2 cups chopped scallions
1 cup chopped baby Portobello mushrooms
1 cup no sugar added marinara sauce
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil + extra to coat pan
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3 eggs, whisked

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 400°F and grease an 8x8 casserole dish with olive oil.
Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and place the squash cut-side down on a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes, until the skin of the squash is fork-tender.
While the squash is baking, prepare the caramelized scallions and mushrooms. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat, then add the scallions and mushrooms. Lower the temperature to medium and cook the scallions and mushrooms until beginning to brown, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, for around 10 minutes. Add the water to the pan and stir the scallions and mushrooms to pick up the brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Cook the scallions and mushrooms for 8-10 minutes, until there is no more water in the pan.
Remove the squash from the oven, scoop out the flesh, and place it in the casserole dish. Stir in the caramelized mushrooms, scallions, marinara sauce, and garlic powder. Add the whisked eggs to the baking dish and mix everything until you can no longer see the eggs.
Bake uncovered for 1 hour in the oven, until the top of the casserole has formed a crust that looks like cheese and is brown around the edges. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
