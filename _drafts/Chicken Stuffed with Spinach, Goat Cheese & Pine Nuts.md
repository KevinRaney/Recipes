Ingredients:
5 ounces fresh spinach chopped
½ cup - 2 ounces- of crumbled low-fat goat cheese
2 tsp pine nuts, toasted
1 tsp fresh thyme, minced
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, minced
4 (8 ounces) skinless, boneless, chicken breast halves
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
4 tsp olive oil
½ cup fat-free, low-sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 F.
Heat a large nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add spinach to pan; cook 1 minute or until spinach wilts, tossing constantly. Place spinach in a colander, press until barely moist. Wipe the pan clean.
Combine spinach, cheese, nuts, thyme, lemon juice, and garlic. Cut a horizontal slit through the thickest portion of each chicken breast half to form a pocket. Stuff 3 tablespoons filling into each pocket. Seal with wooden picks. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in the pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, cook 3 minutes on each side or until brown. Add broth, and cover pan, place pan in the oven. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes or until done.
