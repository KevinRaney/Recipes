Dijon Salmon Cakes and Arugula with Lemon-Caper Oil

Yield:
2 servings

Per serving:
1 Lean protein
3 condiments
1 vegetable serving

Ingredients:
10 oz boneless, skinless pink salmon, drained
2 tsp minced scallion (green and white parts)
3/4 tsp lemon zest
3 1/2 tsp plain Greek yogurt
1 tsp Dijon mustard (divided)
1/2 tsp white horseradish (divided)
1 teaspoon wheat germ
3 tbsp diced celery
1/2 tsp capers, chopped
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 cups baby arugula

Directions:

Using a fork, combine the salmon, scallion, lemon peel, yogurt, mustard, and horseradish in a medium bowl. Add the wheat germ and celery and mix well.
Coat a medium nonstick skillet with pam and place over medium heat about 1 minute. Mix the capers and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Add the arugula and toss to coat. Transfer to a serving plate, forming a bed of the arugula mixture. Set aside
Divide the salmon mixture into 2 round patties, each 1/2 inch thick. Reduce the heat to low and add the patties to the skillet. Cook 2 minutes per side, then flip and cook 1 minute more, or until heated through and lightly browned.
Place on top of the reserved arugula mixture.
