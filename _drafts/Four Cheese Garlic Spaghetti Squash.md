Four Cheese Garlic Spaghetti Squash

Makes 4 servings. Per Serving: ¼ Leaner | 2 Greens | 1 Healthy Fat | 2 Condiments

Ingredients:
5 cups spaghetti squash (10 greens)
4 garlic cloves, minced (4 condiments)
1/2 cup water
1 chicken bouillon cube (1 condiment)
¾ cup half and half (3 healthy fats)
1 cup of low-fat (1 ½ grams fat/oz.) Four-Cheese Italian White Cheese Blend (1 lean)
1 tsp dried thyme (1 condiment)
½ tsp fresh ground pepper (1 condiment)
1 tbsp Parsley, ground (1 condiment)

Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F(200°C). Grab your spaghetti squash firmly and chop off the tip and tail. Cut in half length-wise and scoop out the innards and seeds. Place both halves on a baking sheet, maintained by a small foil ring to ensure stability.
2. In a large bowl, combine minced garlic, heavy cream with 1/2 cup water, crumbled bouillon cube, chives, and fresh thyme. Mix well.
3. Sprinkle a first layer of grated cheese in the cavities of each squash halves. Divide the cream mixture on top of cheese in each halves, then top with additional cheese.
4. Roast in the oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the flesh of the spaghetti squash is very tender when poked with a fork. Remove from oven and serve immediately
