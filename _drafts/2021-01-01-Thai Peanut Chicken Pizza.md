1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet and spray lightly with cooking spray. Combine grated cauliflower, egg beaters, and 1/4 cup cheese until mixed completely. Spoon mixture on prepared pan with parchment paper. Use the back of a spoon to thin out the mixture and form a circle about the size of a dinner plate without the rim. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Flip the pizza crust over. Bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.
