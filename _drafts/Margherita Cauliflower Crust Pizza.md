Margherita Cauliflower Crust Pizza

Ingredients:
4 cups (19.02 oz) cooked Frozen Riced Cauliflower (6 greens)
3 Large Eggs (1 lean)
1/2 tsp Salt (2 condiments)
1/2 tsp Pepper (1 condiment)
1 1/3 cups (5.33 oz) Low fat Shredded Mozzarella (1 1/3 lean)
10 1/4 sec sprays Canola Oil Spray (1 condiment)
4 oz fresh mozzarella (2/3 leaner)
1/2 cup Fresh Chopped Basil Leaves (1/2 condiment)
1/2 cup (3.17 oz) sliced Roma Tomatoes (1 green)
1/2 cup low carb marinara sauce (2 greens)

Directions:

Cauliflower Crust:

Preheat oven to 425º.

Pour cauliflower into a pyrex pie dish; microwave on high for 5 minutes; take out and stir—repeat 3 times (total time in microwave = 20 minutes).

Spread the heated cauliflower over a large piece of parchment paper or clean dish towel and let cool completely. Add eggs, salt and pepper to a large mixing bowl and whip. Pour in cauliflower and cheese; mix well.

Line a quarter-sized sheet pan (about 9 1/2” x 13” x 1”) with parchment paper and spread the cauliflower mixture evenly across the pan.

Place in oven for 25 minutes; remove when the cauliflower is baked to a golden brown on top.

Allow to cool completely in the pan. Use right away or refrigerate or freeze until ready to use. (Once refrigerated or frozen, place in a 350ºF oven for 6 to 10 minutes to bring to room temperature before serving or using in recipes.)
