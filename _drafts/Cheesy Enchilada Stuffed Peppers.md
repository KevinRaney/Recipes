Cheesy Enchilada Stuffed Peppers

Makes 4 servings
Per serving
1 Lean
3 Greens
3 Condiments

Ingredients:
4 cups (10.52 oz) bell peppers~ Roughly 4 peppers (8 Greens)
1 lb cooked 95-97% ground beef, uncooked (2 Leaner)
1 1/2 cups (9.51 oz) frozen riced cauliflower, cooked* (3 Greens)
1 tbsp taco seasoning (6 Condiments)
2 tbsp salsa (2 Condiments)
1/2 cup diced green chiles (1 Green)
1/4 cup enchilada sauce (4 Condiments)
2 cups (8 oz) reduced fat Mexican cheese (2 Lean)

Directions:

Preheat oven to 350F.

Line a baking sheet with foil and set aside.

In a medium skillet, heat ground beef over medium high heat, crumbling as you cook. Stir in the taco seasoning and stir until well coated. When beef is almost cooked through, stir in the green chilies, salsa, cooked cauliflower rice, and enchilada sauce. Turn off heat. Set aside.

Cut the top off each pepper and hollow out the inside; removing ribs and seeds. Place each pepper on the baking sheet.

To stuff each pepper, start with several spoonfuls of beef, then half cup cheese, then fill nearly to the top with beef. Top with another 1/2 cup cheese (depending on size of the pepper, 1/4 cup cheese would be enough. Whatever covers the top to your liking), and place the top back on the pepper. Repeat with remaining peppers.

Bake for 30-40 minutes or until peppers are tender and cheese is melty.
