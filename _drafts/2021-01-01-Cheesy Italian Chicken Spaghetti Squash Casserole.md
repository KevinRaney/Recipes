Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare spaghetti squash by oven or microwave.
Marinate chicken in Italian dressing if desired. Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Add chicken and cook until chicken is no longer pink and cooked thoroughly. Make sure you have 4.5 oz. of chicken when cooked. If you desire more shredded Italian cheese, then use 1/2 Cup cheese and only 3 oz. chicken when cooked. Set aside chicken.
Saute 1 Cup spaghetti squash, Italian diced tomatoes and laughing cow cheese wedges until cheese is melted.
Pour squash mixture in a small casserole dish. Spread cubed chicken over the top. Sprinkle shredded cheese and then Parmesan cheese over the chicken. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until cheese has melted. Serve.

PS I multiplied by 6.  That is basil on top. Seasoned meat salt, pepper, Italian seasoning.
