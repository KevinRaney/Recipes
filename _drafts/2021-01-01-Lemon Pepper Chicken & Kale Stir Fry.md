Lemon Pepper Chicken & Kale Stir Fry

Yield:
3 servings

Per serving:

1 Leaner protein
2 vegetables
3 condiments
1 fat

Ingredients:
3 teaspoons avocado or extra virgin olive oil
3 Tbsps freshly squeezed lemon juice (I love lots of lemons! Adjust to your taste.)
1.5 tsp freshly ground pepper
1 Tbs lemon zest
1 cup leeks, thinly sliced
9 ounces raw chicken breasts(6oz cooked), cut into 1 1/2-inch cube
Non-stick Pam spray
7 cups kale, ribs removed and sliced into strips

Directions:

In a large bowl, whisk together 3 teaspoons oil, lemon juice, pepper, and zest.
Toss cut chicken (in a medium glass bowl) with the marinade and set aside.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add pan spray and begin to caramelize onions, stirring 2 minutes.
Turn heat down to low and cook onions to a golden brown, about 5-6 minutes.
Turn the heat back up to medium-high, toss in chicken with marinade and cook chicken until browned on all sides and cooked through.
Two minutes before the chicken is finished cooking, add sliced kale, and toss to cook.
Serve immediately
