# BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad Sandwich



BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad Sandwich

Yield: 1 Serving
Per Serving: 1 Lean, 1 healthy fat, 2.4 Condiments

Ingredients:
2 Revolution Rolls
3oz chicken breast, grilled and cut into chunks
0.66 ounces of 2% reduced-fat cheddar cheese, shredded
1 tbsp No Sugar Added BBQ Sauce
2 tbsp Light Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing

Directions:
Combine BBQ sauce, ranching dressing, and cheese to chicken and stir until blended. Serve on two revolution rolls.

For the rolls:
3 eggs at room temp
3 Tbsp light cream cheese at room temp
Pinch cream of tartar, white vinegar, or lemon juice
1 packet Splenda (optional) - we did not use this in ours

Preheat oven to 350°
Separate egg whites yolks, putting whites in one bowl, yolks in another.
Add cream of tartar to whites. Beat on high until glossy, smooth, and just form stiff peaks. Set aside.
Add cream cheese and Splenda (if using) to yolks. Whisk the mixture until smooth and well blended.
Add some of the whites to the yolks to lighten them.
Then gently fold the yolk mixture back into the whites, being careful to not over mix and make whites fall.
On a cookie sheet lined with parchment, make six equal-sized blobs, not touching.
Bake at 350°, 25-35 minutes.
