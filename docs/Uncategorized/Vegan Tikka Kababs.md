# Vegan Tikka Kababs



Vegan Tikka Kababs

Yields:
 2 servings - 10 kababs per serving

Per serving:
1 lean 
1 1/2 condiments
1/2 healthy fat 

Ingredients:
 20 Trader Joe's Meatless Meatballs
 1 tsp olive oil
 1/2 tsp garlic, minced
 1 tsp ginger, minced
 1/4 tsp garam masala powder
 1/4 tsp chili powder
 Pinch of turmeric
 1/2 tsp cumin powder
 1/2 tsp coriander powder
 A pinch of dried Fenugreek leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Prep a baking sheet lined with lightly greased parchment paper.
Thaw the meatballs so they're mushy.
Place in a medium bowl and mash until it looks like cookie dough. Set aside.
In a small, shallow pan heat olive oil on medium heat.
Once the oil is hot add garlic and ginger. They should sizzle on contact.
Stir frequently and cook for 15 seconds, or until fragrant and lightly toasted.
Add garam masala, chili powder, turmeric, cumin, and coriander into the pan and mix well. It should look like a clumpy, dry paste.
9Toast this mixture and stir constantly until everything is fragrant and gently smoking about 10-15 seconds.
Add mixture to the meatball-dough.
Add Fenugreek leaves.
Use your hands to combine everything together really well.
Form into 20 little balls. I use a small ice cream scoop to make sure they're about the same size. They don't have to look perfect; that's the beauty of kababs!
Place on a baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes. Kababs should be firm and the bottoms might darken more than the tops, that's totally fine.

**Notes**
If you decide to use yogurt for dipping, this will no longer be considered vegan.
