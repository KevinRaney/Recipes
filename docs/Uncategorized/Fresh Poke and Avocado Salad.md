# Fresh Poke and Avocado Salad

Fresh Poke and Avocado Salad
Makes 2 servings

20 ounces sashimi grade ahi tuna
½ cup finely chopped green onion
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp chili sauce or Sriracha
1 tbsp sesame seeds
4.5 oz avocado, diced
3 cups mixed salad greens (or I like to use cabbage…3/4 cup)

First, cut the ahi tuna into small cubes and transfer them to a medium bowl. Next, add green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili sauce and sesame seeds. Mix well to ensure that the tuna is coated evenly in the sauce mixture. Then, gently mix in the avocado and salad greens, and you’re ready to eat! 

Per serving

2 vegetables (need 1 more if on plan…could add cabbage or cucumbers) 
3 condiments
2 fats
