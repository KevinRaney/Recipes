# Slow Cooker Mushroom Soup

Slow Cooker Mushroom Soup

Serves 4
Per serving: 3 green, 1 fat, ¼ leaner, and ~3 condiments

· 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp olive oil
· 2 garlic cloves, minced
· 6 cups sliced mushrooms (button mushrooms work best)
· 1 Tbsp white balsamic vinegar
· 4 cups vegetable broth
· ½ tsp garlic powder
· 1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme
· ¼ tsp Kosher salt
· 1/4 teaspoons ground black pepper
· 1/4 cup unsweetened almond or cashew milk
· 1 ½ cups plain Greek yogurt
· 1 teaspoon dry dill

Directions
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, add garlic, and mushrooms. Saute until mushrooms are tender. Add the balsamic vinegar and simmer until vinegar has reduced by half.
Transfer to slow cooker and add vegetable broth, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook on high for 2 to 3 hours or on low for 4 to 6 hours.
During the last 15 minutes of cooking time, whisk together milk and yogurt. Add to the soup and whisk until smooth. Continue to cook for the last 15 minutes to allow the soup to thicken.
Remove about half of the soup and transfer to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth and return to the remaining un-blended half. Add the dry dill and stir to mix well. Ladle into bowls and serve.
