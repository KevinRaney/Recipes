Beef Pad Thai (Spaghetti Squash)⁣
⁣
Ingredients:⁣
3 1/2 cups spaghetti squash, cooked (7 Greens)⁣
1 cup cabbage, shredded (2 Greens)⁣
21 oz raw flat sirloin steak tips, boneless - need 15 oz cooked (3 Leans)⁣
1/4 cup reduced sodium beef broth (1/4 Condiment)⁣
4 tbsp Powdered Peanut Butter (2 Snacks)⁣
1 tbsp rice wine vinegar (1/4 Condiment)⁣
2 tbsp light soy sauce (2 Condiments)⁣
1/8 tsp red cayenne pepper (1/4 Condiment)⁣
1/4 tsp ground ginger (1/2 Condiment) ⁣
1/2 tsp garlic powder (1 Condiment) ⁣
*Any additional seasonings for the steak⁣
⁣
Garnishes:⁣
2 tbsp dry roasted peanuts, chopped, optional (1 Snack)⁣
A few sprigs of Cilantro, chopped⁣
⁣
Directions:⁣
Poke holes on all sides of the spaghetti squash with a metal skewer or a fork. Place a paper towel in microwave and place squash on top of paper towel. Microwave in increments of 3 minutes until flesh starts to get soft. I had a medium sized squash and microwaved for about 10 minutes. Let cool. Cut squash in half, lengthwise. Scoop the seeds and the middle strands out with a spoon and discard. Next, scrape the inside of the squash with a fork all the way to the skin. Set aside.I seasoned the steak with McCormick's Grill mates Montreal Steak Seasoning and placed them on the grill. Cook until desired doneness. Once meat is cooked, slice meat into 1 inch strips and set aside. In a small bowl, combine beef broth, powdered Peanut Butter, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, red cayenne pepper, ground ginger, and garlic powder. ⁣
Coat a large non-stick skillet with cooking spray. Add spaghetti squash, cabbage, and sauce . You could add the beef as well, but I waited until the end after dividing the veggies into three portions. Heat over medium heat for 5 minutes or until sauce has coated all. ⁣
⁣
Divide among 3 plates/bowls and top each dish with 5 oz of cooked beef. Add chopped peanuts, and cilantro as a garnish.⁣
