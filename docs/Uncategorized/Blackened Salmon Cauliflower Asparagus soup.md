5 oz cooked salmon (1 lean)
90 grams of cooked asparagus (1 green)
124 grams of cooked cauliflower (2 greens)
1/2 cup of low sodium chicken broth (1 condiment)

Black pepper 
Ancho Chile powder (smaller)
Onion powder (medium)
Garlic powder (small)
Curry powder (large)
Green onion to top at finish (very small)

Directions:
*Note that I don’t have measurements for dried spices and green onion. I put which ones to use more, less, or medium amounts of*

Add chicken broth and water to medium sauce pan and bring to a boil and add cauliflower. Once it comes to a boil again, reduce temp to medium low to cook down to a stew constancy. "Not as soupy" once thicker, add a wedge of laughing cow cheese and simmer.

Rub black pepper and anchor Chile powder to both sides of salmon.
Spray olive oil or avocado oil to cast-iron skillet and cook salmon. Let it rest while cooking asparagus in same skillet or air fryer with spray oil until crispy.

Put soup in a bowl topped with asparagus and then salmon.

Finish with green onion.
