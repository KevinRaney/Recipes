Yield:
1 Serving

Per serving:
1 Lean
3 Green
2 Condiments

Ingredients:
5 Trader Joe flame-broiled turkey meatballs or 10 butterball Italian style turkey meatballs or 6 Jennie-O Homestyle Meatballs
1 cup Italian diced tomatoes
1/2 cup zucchini, chopped
1 1/2 cups low sodium beef broth
1/2 tsp dried basil leaves

Directions:
Heat meatballs in microwave for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. I did this so I could cut the meatballs in 4 pieces. You could place them in the saucepan whole if desired.

Puree diced tomatoes in a small chopper, blender or magic bullet until desired consistency. I did it for 5 seconds so that it resembles more of a sauce than chunks of tomatoes.

Combine meatballs, zucchini, tomatoes, beef broth and basil in a medium saucepan.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Let simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes.
