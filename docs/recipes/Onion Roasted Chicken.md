# Onion Roasted Chicken

Onion Roasted Chicken

Makes 8 servings
1 protein
3 condiments
1 fat

Ingredients:
8 pieces of bone-in chicken breasts - 6 oz each -cooked
1 1/2 packets French Onion Soup Mix
4 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 tsp garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In a large bowl or Ziploc bag, combine all ingredients and mix until all the seasonings are coating the chicken.
Pour into a 9x13 pan in an even layer.
Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear. I like to baste the chicken a couple of times while it's baking. Enjoy!
