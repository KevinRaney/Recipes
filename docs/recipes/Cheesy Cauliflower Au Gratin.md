# Cheesy Cauliflower Au Gratin

Cheesy Cauliflower Au Gratin 

Ingredients:
4 cups raw cauliflower florets
4 tbsp butter
1/3 heavy whipping cream
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp pepper
6 ounces low fat pepper jack cheese

Directions:
In a microwave safe dish, combine the cauliflower, butter, cream, salt and pepper and mix thoroughly. Microwave on high for about 25 minutes, or until tender. (You can always start with 10 minutes, then 10 more, then 5 more if you think it is necessary. Some microwaves cook different than others. You want it soft enough to mash with a fork. The longer it stays in, the thicker the sauce gets.) Remove from the microwave and mash with a fork or potato masher. Lay the slices of cheese across the top of the cauliflower. Microwave for another 2-3 minutes or until cheese has melted. Serve hot.

Makes 8 servings
Per serving: 1 vegetable (you need 2 more), 1 healthy fat (must serve with leaner or leanest meat), 1 condiment, ¾ ounce protein
