# Turkey Tetrazzini

Yield:
8 Servings

Per serving:
1/2 Leaner
2 Green
3 Condiments, 1/4 Healthy Fat

## Ingredients
* 5 cups spaghetti squash
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1/2 cup onion diced
* 9 oz baby Bella mushrooms
* 1 large red bell pepper
* 1 tsp Kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp sage
* 1 tsp thyme
* 6 oz. low-fat cream cheese
* 1/2 cup almond milk unsweetened
* 20 oz lean turkey breast oven-roasted, no skin
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Directions
1. Cut the squash in half, hollowing out of the seeds with a spoon, and placing each half face-down on a baking sheet. Roast the spaghetti squash for 25 minutes in a 425° oven
2. While the squash cooks, saute the onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of butter with all of the seasonings until they become soft. Turn the heat to low and add the cream cheese. Break it apart and mix until it melts creamy and smooth. Add the almond milk to thin the mixture.
3. When the squash is done baking, use an oven mitt to hold each half and scrape out the "spaghetti" into a large mixing bowl with a fork. Add the cooked turkey and creamy vegetable mixture. Toss to combine and transfer everything to a baking dish. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and bake for 30 minutes at 350° until the top becomes golden brown
