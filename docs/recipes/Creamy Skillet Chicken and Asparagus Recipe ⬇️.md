Creamy Skillet Chicken and Asparagus Recipe ⬇️ 

Ingredients:
• 4 tsp olive oil (4 healthy fats)
• 36.4 oz boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1" chunks ~ Should yield 24 oz cooked (4 leaners)
• 1/2 C low sodium chicken broth (1/2 condiment)
• 2 tsp fresh chopped garlic (2 condiments)
• 2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley (1/2 condiment)
• 4 tbsp fresh chopped chives (1 condiment)
• 4 tbsp light cream cheese (4 condiments)
• 4 cups (18.88 oz) fresh asparagus, cut into 2" pieces (8 greens)

Instructions:
Add oil to a large skillet and heat over medium high heat.
When hot, add chicken breasts and cook for 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The chicken should be slightly browned.
Pour the broth into the pan and, using a spatula, scrape all the browned bits (fond) off the bottom of the pan.
Add garlic seasoning, cream cheese and asparagus. Turn the heat to high.
Stir the ingredients continually, allowing the cream cheese to melt evenly into the sauce. Bring to a boil and simmer until a thick, rich sauce has formed. Divide into 4 equal portions, and serve hot!

4 Servings - Each serving provides: 1 Leaner | 2 Green | 1 Healthy Fat | 2 Condiment options
