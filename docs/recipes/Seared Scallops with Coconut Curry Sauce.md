# Seared Scallops with Coconut Curry Sauce
Slightly adapted from Robin Seidel

## Ingredients:
* 9 oz. dry scallops (1 Lean)
* 1/8 tsp Lemon pepper (1/4 Condiment)
* 1/8 tsp Curry Powder (1/4 Condiment)
* 1/8 tsp Coriander (1/4 Condiment)
* 2 teaspoon olive oil (2 Healthy Fats)
* 1 tbsp Starport's coconut curry sauce (2 Condiments)
* 1 tbsp low sodium chicken broth or water
* Scallions, thinly sliced

## 

## Directions:
1. Rinse, then pat the scallops dry. Combine lemon pepper, curry powder, coriander and salt. 
2. Sprinkle both sides of scallops with seasoning blend. 
3. Place olive oil in a non-stick skillet, heat over medium-high heat until sizzling then add the scallops. 
4. Sear until nicely browned on one side, flip and cook on the other side. Touch them to gauge their level of doneness; they need to have a little give but not too much, take care not to overcook to where theyâ€™re hard to the touch. Remove to a plate, cover.
5. Combine coconut curry sauce and chicken broth in a very small bowl. Spoon over top of scallops. Sprinkle sliced scallions over the top. 
6. Serve over grated and cooked cauliflower.
