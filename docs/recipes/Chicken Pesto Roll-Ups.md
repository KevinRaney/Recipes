Preheat large oven-safe skillet over medium/high heat with 1 Tbsp oil and. Add chicken roll-ups and sear on both sides until golden (4 min per side or 8 minutes total on the stove).

Sprinkle tops with remaining cheese and 1 cup of cherry tomatoes. Place the skillet on the center rack of oven and bake 425˚F for 13-15 minutes (13 min for these these medium chicken breasts and 15 min for larger chicken breasts, or until internal temp of chicken reaches 160˚F on instant-read thermometer.
