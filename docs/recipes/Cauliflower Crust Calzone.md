# Cauliflower Crust Calzone

Cauliflower Crust Calzone

Yield:
3 servings

Per serving:

2 vegetables
1 2/3 ounces protein
3 condiments

Ingredients:

Crust:

1 small head cauliflower, cut into small florets (should yield about 3 cups once processed)
½ cup / 1.7 oz / 50 gr mozzarella cheese, shredded
1 free-range egg, lightly beaten
½ teaspoon fine grain sea salt
½ teaspoon oregano
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Filling:

6 tablespoons thick tomato sauce
½ cup / 1.7 oz / 50 gr mozzarella cheese
pinch of salt

Directions:

Preheat oven to 450°F and place a rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease it with olive oil. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until mushrooms are brown, stirring every so often about 5 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook for 1 further minute. Add spinach stirring just until wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
Transfer the cauliflower rice to a mixing bowl and add egg, mozzarella, oregano, sea salt, and pepper. Mix well.
Using your hands, press the mixture onto the baking sheet and shape into four discs (diameter should be about 4 inches).
Place in the oven and bake for 10 (no more no less, 10 minutes).
Remove from the oven and, working quickly, top with a bit of mozzarella cheese, then mushroom mixture, distributing evenly. Sprinkle some more mozzarella over mushrooms. Using a large spatula carefully lift the half of the disc without filling and fold it over the other part (that’s ok if the disc brakes a bit).
Use your fingers to push the edges of each calzone together and seal in the filling.
Bake in the oven for an additional 12 minutes
