# TERIYAKI BEEF ASPARAGUS SKEWERS

TERIYAKI BEEF ASPARAGUS SKEWERS

Makes 2 servings

Each serving provides:
1 lean | 1 green | 3 condiments

Ingredients:
12.5 ounces boneless beef or bison rib-eye steak, 1 inch thick
¾ cup medium-thick asparagus, ends trimmed, cut into 1½-inch lengths
¼ cup green onions, trimmed, cut into 1 ½-inch lengths 
1/2 cup (1.52 oz) baby bella mushrooms
One tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons teriyaki sauce
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
1. Prepare a charcoal grill, and let coals burn until they are covered with gray ash. Or, preheat a gas grill until hot. Meanwhile, soak 4 bamboo skewers in water to cover at least 20 minutes. Drain.

2. Use a very sharp knife to slice the steak across the grain into ¼-inch wide slices. Thread, alternating, the beef slices, asparagus, mushrooms and green onions on the skewers.

3. Place the skewers directly over the hot coals. Brush with some of the teriyaki sauce. Grill until lightly charred, about 2 minutes. Gently flip the skewers and baste the other side with the sauce.

4. Cook until steak is medium-rare, about 1 minute more. Remove from the grill, and drizzle with the remaining teriyaki sauce.
