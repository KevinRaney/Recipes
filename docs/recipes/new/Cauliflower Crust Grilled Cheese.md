# Cauliflower Crust Grilled Cheese

Cauliflower Crust Grilled Cheese

Yield:

2 servings

Per serving: 

3 vegetables 
½ Lean protein 
2 1/4 condiments

Ingredients:

Cauliflower crust “bread” slices
10 sprays non-stick pan spray – divided use
1 small head cauliflower, cut into small florets (should yield 3 cups of cauliflower rice)
1 free-range organic egg, lightly beaten
½ cup / 1.7 oz / 50 gr shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
½ teaspoon fine grain sea salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
Grilled cheese
10 sprays non-stick pan spray
1/2 cup / 2 oz / 85 gr low fat sharp cheddar cheese, grated/shredded, room temperature

Directions:

Cauliflower crust “bread” slices
Preheat oven to 450°F (220°C) and place a rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray it with 5 sprays pan spray. Set aside. In a food processor rice the cauliflower florets (it should be evenly chopped but not completely pulverized). Transfer cauliflower rice (about 3 cups) to a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 8 minutes, until cooked.
Place the cauliflower rice in a tea towel and twist it to squeeze as much moisture as you can (I usually squeeze out over a cup of liquid). This is very important. The cauliflower rice needs to be dry, otherwise you’ll end up with mushy dough, impossible to use as slices of bread.
Transfer the cauliflower rice to a mixing bowl, add egg, mozzarella, salt, pepper and mix well. Spread cauliflower mixture onto the lined baking sheet and shape it into 4 squares. Place in the oven and bake for about 16 minutes until golden. Remove and let cool 10 minutes before peeling them off the parchment paper (be careful not to break them!)
Assemble cauliflower crust grilled cheese
Heat a pan over medium heat. Spray one side of each slice of cauliflower crust bread (preferably the top part). Place one slice of bread in the pan, sprayed side down, sprinkle with the cheese, and top with the remaining slice of cauliflower crust bread, sprayed side up. Turn the heat down a notch and cook.
