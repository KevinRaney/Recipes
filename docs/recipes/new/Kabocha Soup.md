6 servings

Per serving:
1 vegetable
3 condiments

Ingredients:
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 tsp. salt
2 cups kabocha puree
1 cup chopped leeks
1/2 tsp. chopped fresh thyme
1 clove garlic, minced
6 whole black peppercorns
1/2 tsp. freshly ground ginger
1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a large pot, combine all ingredients except heavy cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, uncovered.

Using a food processor or blender, puree soup in small batches (1 cup at a time). Or, use an immersion blender to blend right in the pot. Return soup to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for another 30 minutes, uncovered. Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream.

Top with crab meat for your protein if you like!
