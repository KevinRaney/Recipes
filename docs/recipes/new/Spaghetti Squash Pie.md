# Spaghetti Squash Pie

Spaghetti Squash Pie

Ingredients 
* 12 ounces cooked spaghetti squash 
* ½ cup leeks, chopped finely 
* 1 pound ground turkey or sirloin beef 
* 3/4 cup no sugar added Marinara Sauce 
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste 
* 3 large eggs 
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese 
* 1½ cup shredded part skim mozzarella 
* 10 sprays olive oil spray 
* ¼ teaspoon Salt

Directions 
Preheat oven to 350. In a large skillet, sauté the leeks until soft. Add ground turkey or beef, and ¾ cup Marinara sauce. Season with salt. Consistency should be like a thick Bolognese sauce. Add more water as needed. In a large bowl, mix together the cooked spaghetti squash, eggs, parmesan cheese, 1 cup of the mozzarella, and 2 tablespoons tomato paste. Grease a 9 or 10-inch pie pan with olive oil spray. Spread half the meat mixture over the bottom of the pan. Add the spaghetti mixture and press it down to level it. Top with the remaining meat mixture, then scatter the remaining mozzarella on top. Bake the pie in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit about 10 minutes. Use a sharp knife or pizza slicer to cut into wedges like a pie. Serve with a green salad.
