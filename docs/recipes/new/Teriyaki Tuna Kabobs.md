# Teriyaki Tuna Kabobs

## Ingredients:
* 4 Ahi tuna steaks (10 ounces each), cut into 1-1/2-in. chunks (4 leanest)
* 1 cup (5.26 oz) sweet red pepper, cut into 1-in. pieces (2 greens)
* 1 cup (6.34 oz) large leeks, cut into 1-in. pieces (2 greens)

## MARINADE/DRESSING:
* 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
* 4 teaspoons sesame oil (4 healthy fats)
* 3 tablespoons lime juice (4 1/2 condiments)
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce (2 condiments)
* 4 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil (4 healthy fats)
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh gingerroot (1 1/2 condiments)
* 2 garlic cloves, minced (2 condiments)

## SALAD:
* 5 cups (5.3 oz) fresh baby spinach (5 greens)
* 1/2 cup (2.63 oz) medium sweet yellow pepper, cut into 1-in. pieces (1 green)
* 1 cup (5.26 oz) cherry tomatoes, halved (2 greens)

## Directions:

1. Thread tuna chunks onto four metal or soaked wooden skewers. Thread pepper and Leek pieces onto four more skewers. Place skewers in a 13x9-in. baking dish.

1. Whisk together marinade ingredients. Reserve half of mixture for salad dressing. Pour remaining marinade over skewers; refrigerate, covered, 30 minutes.

1. Grill kabobs, covered, on a greased grill rack over medium heat, turning occasionally, until tuna is slightly pink in center for medium-rare (2-3 minutes per side) and vegetables are crisp-tender (10-12 minutes). Remove tuna kabobs from direct heat and keep warm while vegetables finish grilling.
2. For salad, toss spinach, yellow pepper and cherry tomatoes with reserved dressing. For each portion, serve a tuna kabob and vegetable kabob over salad
