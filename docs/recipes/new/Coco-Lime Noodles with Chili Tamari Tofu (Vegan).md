Coco-Lime Noodles with Chili Tamari Tofu (Vegan)

Yield: 2 Servings

Per serving:
1 Lean | 3 Greens | 3 Condiments | 1 Healthy Fat

Ingredients:
2 kgs Shirataki noodles
2 15 oz packs extra firm tofu ( cubed, drained, and pressed to remove liquid)
1 tbsp slow sodium Tamari( also known as gluten-free soy sauce)
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp fresh ginger, minced
1.8 oz scallions, chopped
2.8 oz baby Bella mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup lite coconut milk ( canned variety)
Juice & zest of 1 lime
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
Sprinkling of salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F
Drain the liquid in the package of the Shirataki noodles, then rinse them under running water well. Give them a quick stir-fry in a hot pan without oil to get the rest of the liquid out. Set aside.
Gently mix tofu cubes, Tamari, and cayenne. Spread onto a baking sheet and bake for approximately 25 mins or until the tofu has browned and firmed up.
In a large and wide skillet spray some cooking oil and add ginger, scallions, and mushrooms.
Saute until sizzling and fragrant.
Add coconut milk, lime juice and zest, pepper flakes, and salt.
Then add the Shirataki noodles you had set aside. Cover and let simmer for 10 mins.
Once the tofu is done, add it to the noodle mixture and gently combine all ingredients.
Separate into 2 equal portions and serve!
