Ingredients:
7.5 oz cooked 93% lean ground beef, fat drained (1 1/2 Leans)
1 1/2 tsp low sodium taco seasoning mix (3 Condiments)
5 cups cooked cauliflower, cut into small florets (10 Greens)
1/2 cup chopped green chilies (1 Green)
1/2 cup green or red peppers, diced (1 Green)
2 tbsp jalapenos, chopped (2 Condiments)

For the sauce:
1 cup unsweetened cashew milk (1 Condiment)
3 tbsp reduced fat cream cheese (3 Condiments)
1 tsp dijon mustard (1 Condiment)
1 1/2 tbsp Kraft parmesan cheese, grated (1 1/2 Condiments)
1/4 tsp garlic powder (1/2 Condiment)
1 1/2 cups shredded reduced fat Mexican or sharp cheddar cheese (1 1/2 Leans)

Topping:
1 cup shredded reduced fat Mexican or sharp cheddar cheese (1 Lean)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9 inch square casserole dish lightly with cooking spray.
Combine cooked ground beef with taco seasoning mix and 1/4 cup water in a small skillet. Heat over medium high heat. Cook until sauce thickens, about 4 to 5 minutes stirring occasionally.
In a large bowl, combine seasoned ground beef, cauliflower pieces, green chilies, green or red peppers and jalapenos. Set aside.
Pour cashew milk into a medium sized sauce pan over medium-low heat. Add the cream cheese, dijon mustard, parmesan cheese, and garlic powder. Stir until combined and cream cheese is melted. Add 1 1/2 cups cheese. Continue cooking until cheese is melted and sauce is nice and smooth, about 2 minutes.
Pour the cheese sauce over the cauliflower beef mixture and stir until everything is coated with the cheese sauce. Pour mixture into a prepared dish. Sprinkle 1 cup of cheese over the top. Bake for about 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Divide into 4 even portions.
