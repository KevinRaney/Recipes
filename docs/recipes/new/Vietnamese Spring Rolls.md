## Directions
1. Spray a skillet lightly with non-stick cooking spray, and sauté mushrooms over medium-high heat until tender. Transfer mushrooms to a medium bowl and allow to cool slightly.
2. Mix pre-cooked shrimp, peanuts, hot sauce, fish sauce, mint, and cilantro in with the mushrooms.
3. Place the lettuce leaves flat on a cutting board. Fill each with a portion of the shrimp mixture, and top with sprouts.
