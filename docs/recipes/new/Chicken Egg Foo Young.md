# Chicken Egg Foo Young

## Ingredients
* 1.5 teaspoon sesame oil, divided (1.5 Healthy Fats)
* 1/4 cup chopped green onion (1/2 Green)
* 1/4 cup chopped celery (1/2 Green)
* 1 cup cabbage, shredded (2 Greens)
* 3.5 oz chicken cooked (1/2 Lean)
* 1 tbsp lite soy sauce (1 Condiment)
* 1/8 tsp garlic powder (1/4 Condiment)
* 1/8 tsp onion powder (1/4 Condiment)
* 1/8 tsp ground red pepper - Optional (1/4 Condiment)
* 1 cup egg beaters (1/2 Leanest Lean)

## Directions
1. In a skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tsp sesame oil and lightly fry celery, cabbage and green onion.
2. It is very important not to overcook your veggies. You can use any approved veggie as a substitute for the veggies listed such as zucchini, bean sprouts, green peppers, red peppers, mushrooms, etc. 
3. Add chicken, soy sauce, garlic powder and onion powder.
4. Stir until well blended. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.
5. Return the pan to heat, and add 1 tsp sesame oil. When oil is heated, add egg beaters. 
6. Fry the eggs while stirring gently. Return the vegetable and chicken mixture to the pan while the eggs are still liquid. 
7. Finish frying until eggs are fully cooked. I flipped my omelette halfway through. 
8. Serve warm.

1 Lean, 3 Greens, 1.5 Healthy Fats (this is correct amount needed for the day since you are splitting between a lean and a leaner protein) and 1.75 Condiments
