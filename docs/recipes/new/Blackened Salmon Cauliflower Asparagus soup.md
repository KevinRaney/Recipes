Directions:
*Note that I donâ€™t have measurements for dried spices and green onion. I put which ones to use more, less, or medium amounts of*

Add chicken broth and water to medium sauce pan and bring to a boil and add cauliflower. Once it comes to a boil again, reduce temp to medium low to cook down to a stew constancy. "Not as soupy" once thicker, add a wedge of laughing cow cheese and simmer.

Spray olive oil or avocado oil to cast-iron skillet and cook salmon. Let it rest while cooking asparagus in same skillet or air fryer with spray oil until crispy.
