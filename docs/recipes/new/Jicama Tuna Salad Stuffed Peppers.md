Jicama Tuna Salad Stuffed Peppers

Ingredients:
4.6 oz canned tuna, drained (2/3 Lean)*
1 1/2 Tbsp lite mayo (1 Healthy Fat)
1/4 tsp Trader Joe's chili lime seasoning or seasoning of choice (1 Condiment)
1 tsp dijon mustard (1 Condiment)
1 tsp lime juice (1/2 Condiment)
1/8 tsp fresh ground black pepper (1/4 Condiment)
2 tbsp fresh cilantro, finely chopped (1/8 Condiment)
1/4 cup celery, chopped (1/2 Green)
1/4 cup jicama, chopped (1/2 Green)
1 bell pepper sliced in half lengthwise, top and membrane removed (2 Greens)
2 slices Reduced Fat Provolone cheese slices (1/3 Lean)

Directions:
Drain can of tuna, empty in a small mixing bowl and shred with a fork. Add mayo, chili lime seasoning, dijon mustard, lime juice, black pepper and mix well. Add cilantro and celery. Mix to combine.
Stuff the two pepper halves with tuna mixture. Place provolone cheese slices on each half. Broil the peppers for a few min or until cheese melts. If you prefer your peppers to be soft rather than crunchy, boil your peppers in boiling water for 5 min or until desired tenderness. 

*If you do not want cheese, use 7 oz of tuna for a full lean and add 1 more Healthy Fat.

1 Lean, 3 Greens, 3 Condiments, and 1 Healthy Fat per Serving
