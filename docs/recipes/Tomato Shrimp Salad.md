# Tomato Shrimp Salad

Tomato Shrimp Salad

1 complete Lean & Green
Ingredients:

8 oz raw shrimp, peeled and de-veined, or 7 oz fully cooked frozen shrimp, thawed (either starting portion should yield one 7-oz cooked serving)
1 cup romaine lettuce, chopped or shredded
½ cup (1 medium 2-3/5”) tomato, diced
½ cup cucumber, sliced
4 Tbsp Newman’s Own® Lighten Up Sun-Dried Tomato Dressing, divided

Directions:

Marinate shrimp in 3 Tbsp Newman’s Own® Lighten Up Sun-Dried Tomato Dressing for 1-2 hours. Prepare the salad by washing vegetables and cutting them as indicated above; set aside. After shrimp has sufficiently marinated, pour entire contents (shrimp and marinade) into a skillet and cook over medium heat until shrimp are cooked through (or turn opaque in color), about 3-5 minutes. Place shrimp on top of the salad and drizzle 1 Tbsp Newman’s Own® Lighten Up Sun-Dried Tomato Dressing over
