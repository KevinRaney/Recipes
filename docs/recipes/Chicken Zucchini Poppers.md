# Chicken Zucchini Poppers

Chicken Zucchini Poppers

2 servings with each:
1 leaner
3 green
3 condiments

Ingredients:
1 lb. ground chicken breast
2 cups grated zucchini (leave the peel on)
2-3 green onions, sliced
3-4 Tbsp cilantro, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
¾ tsp salt
½ tsp pepper

Directions:
Mix ground chicken and remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Grease frying pan or skillet with olive oil.
Spoon out 8-10 nugget-sized pieces onto the oiled skillet (I like to use a small ice-cream scoop). Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes on each side.
Serve plain or with favorite approved dipping sauce.
