# Slow Cooker Cashew Chicken

Slow Cooker Cashew Chicken

Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs or 24 oz raw chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces (3 Leaner)

For Sauce:
1/4 cup lite soy sauce (4 Condiments)
2 tbsp reduced sugar ketchup (2 Condiments)
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar (1/2 Condiment)
1 packet of stevia or sweetener of choice (1 Condiment)
1 tsp minced garlic (1 Condiment)
1/4 tsp ground ginger (1/2 Condiment)

Garnish:
1 ounce cashews, chopped (3 Healthy Fats)
Sliced green onions ~ optional but subtract from your greens if using

Spray a non-stick skillet with cooking spray and season chicken with salt and pepper, if desired. Brown chicken in skillet, stirring occasionally for about 3 to 4 min. It will continue to cook in the slow cooker. Add chicken to the slow cooker.

Make the sauce. Combine soy sauce, ketchup, vinegar, sweetener of choice, garlic and ginger in a small bowl. Pour the sauce over chicken. Gently toss chicken with sauce to coat. Cook on LOW for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Since the chicken is browned in the skillet first, it doesn't need a lot of time in the slow cooker. This method results in moist cubed chunks of chicken. If you want the chicken to be shredded in texture, you can use whole raw chicken breasts and cook on HIGH for 4 hours or LOW for 8 hours. Then shred the chicken with a fork after cooking or cube. 

Garnish with 1/3 ounce of chopped cashews and sliced green onions per serving. Serve immediately. Enjoy!

3 Servings with
1 Leaner, 3 Condiments, and 1 Healthy Fat per serving
