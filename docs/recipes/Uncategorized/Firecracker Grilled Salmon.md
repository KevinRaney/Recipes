Firecracker Grilled Salmon

Ingredients:
· 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar (3 condiments)
· 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce (2 condiments)
· 1/2 cup (1.76 oz) green onion, thinly sliced (1 green)
· 10 sprays olive oil spray (1 condiment)
· 2 tablespoon walden farms maple syrup (1 condiment)
· 1 garlic clove, minced (1 condiment)
· 1 teaspoon ground ginger (1 condiment)
· 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (2 condiments)
· 1/4 teaspoon salt (1 condiment)
· 4 8oz raw salmon fillets (4 leans)

Directions:
1. In a small bowl, combine the first 9 ingredients. Pour 1/4 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag. Add the salmon; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for as long as you want because I don't believe in hard and fast rules. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.

2. Drain salmon, discarding used marinade. Using long-handled tongs, moisten a paper towel with pam and lightly coat the grill rack. Place salmon skin side down on grill rack. Grill, covered, over high heat or broil 3-4 in. from the heat for 5-10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, basting occasionally with remaining marinade.

Makes 4 servings and per serving you will receive:
· 1 lean protein
· ¼ green
· 3 condiments
