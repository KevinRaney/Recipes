# Spaghetti Squash Caprese Bake

Spaghetti Squash Caprese Bake

Yield:

2 servings 

per serving:

1 Lean protein
3 Greens
3 Condiments

Ingredients:

SQUASH:
1 ½ cups spaghetti squash
¼ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper

FILLING:
2 cloves garlic, minced
½ cup green onion, diced
1 cup cherry tomato, halved
¼ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
8 oz. mini part-skim mozzarella ball (2 LEAN)
fresh basil, to garnish

Directions:

Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC).
With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half. If the squash is too tough, puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash. Microwave for 3-5 minutes to soften. Allow cooling before cutting in half.
Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a fork can easily pierce the skin.
In a pan over medium heat, add the oil, garlic, and green onion, and sautè
Add the cherry tomatoes, salt, and pepper and simmer until they are cooked and begin to become softened.
Remove squash from the oven, with a fork pull at the edges to produce that stringy “spaghetti” quality. Add the squash to the tomato mixture and mix it in the pan. 
Add mixture back to the hollowed-out spaghetti squash halves. Top with mini mozzarella balls and basil.
Bake an additional 5-10 minutes, or until cheese melts.
Serve in the squash, and top with basil.
