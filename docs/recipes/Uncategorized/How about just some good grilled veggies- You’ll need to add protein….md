# How about just some good grilled veggies? You’ll need to add protein…

Grilled zucchini with lemon and feta 

Makes 3 servings
2 greens
3 condiments
** Need a healthy protein

Ingredients:
3 cups medium zucchini, cut on the bias into 1/2 inch thick slices 
1 tbsp olive oil, for grilling
1/4 tsp kosher salt 
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
4 ounces reduced fat crumbled feta cheese
1/2 tbsp lemon zest
4 tsp lemon juice
2 tablespoons minced fresh mint 

Directions:
Preheat a grill or grill pan over high high heat.
Place the sliced zucchini in a medium bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle generously with kosher salt and ground black pepper. Toss with your hands until all the zucchini are evenly coated with oil and salt and pepper.
Add half of the zucchini to the grill (you'll probably need a grill basket) or grill pan. Grill for a few minutes on each side, until the zucchini is nicely charred but just tender. Remove to a large bowl & repeat with the second half of the zucchini.
As the zucchini cools, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and fresh mint. Pour over the warm zucchini.
Sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese over the zucchini & toss to combine. Serve warm or at room temperature.
