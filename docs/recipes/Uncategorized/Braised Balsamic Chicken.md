# Braised Balsamic Chicken 😋

Braised Balsamic Chicken 😋

• 6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves – total weight 3 1/3 pounds
• 1 teaspoon garlic salt
• ½ teaspoon ground black pepper to taste
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• ½ cup green onion, thinly sliced
• 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
• 3 Tbs balsamic vinegar
• 1 teaspoon dried basil
• 1 teaspoon dried oregano
• 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
• 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions
Season both sides of chicken breasts with garlic salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook seasoned chicken breasts until chicken is browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Pour diced tomatoes and balsamic vinegar over chicken; season with basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
