Greek Chicken Stew 🍗 

Makes 4 servings
Per serving
1 Leaner protein
3 vegetables
2 condiments
1 fat

• 1 Tbs olive oil
• 1/2 cup leeks, chopped
• 2 garlic cloves (to taste), minced
•36 ounces of boneless, skinless chicken breasts
• 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
• 1 28-ounce can low sodium chopped tomatoes, with juice, pulsed in a food processor
• ½ teaspoon cinnamon
• ¼ tsp Salt
½ tsp freshly ground pepper
• ½ teaspoon dried thyme, or 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
• 2 cups cauliflower, broken into florets, and sliced about 1/2 inch thick
• 12 kalamata olives (about 45 grams), rinsed, pitted and cut in half (optional)
• 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
PREPARATION
1. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat in a large, deep, heavy lidded skillet or casserole and brown the chicken, in batches if necessary, about 5 minutes on each side. Remove the pieces to a plate or bowl as they’re browned. Pour off the fat from the pan. Add the vinegar to the pan and scrape up all the bits from the bottom of the pan.
2. Add the remaining olive oil to the pan, and turn the heat down to medium. Add the leeks and salt and cook, stirring often and scraping the bottom of the pan, until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat to low, cover and let the leeks cook for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, until it is lightly browned and very soft.
3. Add the garlic and stir together for a minute or two more, until the garlic is fragrant, then add the tomatoes and their juice, the cinnamon, thyme, and pepper . Bring to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the mixture is reduced slightly and fragrant.
4. Return the chicken pieces to the pot, along with any juices that have accumulated in the bowl. If necessary, add enough water to barely cover the chicken. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.
5. Add the cauliflower and kalamata olives and simmer for another 20 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender. Stir in the parsley.
Advance preparation: The stew keeps for 3 or 4 days in the refrigerator and freezes well.
