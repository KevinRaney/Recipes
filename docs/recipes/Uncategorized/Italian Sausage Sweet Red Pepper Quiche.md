# Italian Sausage Sweet Red Pepper Quiche

## Ingredients
* 6 ounces cooked Jennie-O Sweet Italian turkey sausage links (1 Lean)
* 4 eggs (1 1/2 Lean with 2 egg whites)
* 2 egg whites
* 1 1/2 cups sweet red bell pepper, chopped (3 Greens)
* 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (1 Condiment)
* 1 cup shredded 2% sharp cheddar cheese (1 Lean)
* 1/4 tsp salt (1 Condiment)
* 1/4 tsp pepper (1/2 Condiment)
* 2 tbsp reduced fat grated parmesan cheese (1 Condiment)
* 1 Lite Cali-flour Foods cauliflower crust (1/2 Lean, 3 Greens)

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Remove pizza crust from freezer to thaw.
3. Remove sausage from casings. In a medium sized skillet, brown sausage over medium high heat until cooked. Drain and set aside.
4. Grease a 9 inch pie dish. When crust is thawed, place in pie dish. The crust fit perfectly on the bottom of my pie dish! Bake in oven for 5 minutes. For extra crisp on the crust, broil on high for 2 more minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven and set aside.
5. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, egg whites and unsweetened almond milk together. Stir in cheddar cheese, cooked sausage, and chopped red pepper. Add salt, pepper and grated parmesan cheese stirring until combined. Add egg mixture to pie dish.
6. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove and let cool in pie dish for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
