Oven-Roasted Chicken Shawarma

Makes 4 servings
Each serving provides:
1 leaner
½ green
1 healthy fat
3 condiments

• 2 tablespoons lemon juice
• 4 teaspoons olive oil
• 1 clove garlic, peeled, smashed and minced
• ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
• ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
• ½ teaspoons ground cumin
• ½ teaspoons paprika
• ½ teaspoon turmeric
• ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
• ¼ tsp Red pepper flakes, to taste
• 36 ounces raw boneless, skinless chicken breasts
• 1 cup scallions
• 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

PREPARATION
Prepare a marinade for the chicken. Combine the lemon juice, 3 tsp. olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon and red pepper flakes in a large bowl, then whisk to combine. Add the chicken and toss well to coat. Cover and store in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
When ready to cook, heat oven to 425 degrees. Use the remaining teaspoon of olive oil to grease a rimmed sheet pan. Add the scallions to the chicken and marinade, and toss once to combine. Remove the chicken and scallions from the marinade, and place on the pan, spreading everything evenly across it.

Put the chicken in the oven and roast until it is browned, crisp at the edges and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to rest 2 minutes, then slice into bits. Scatter the parsley over the top, surround with lemon wedges and serve
