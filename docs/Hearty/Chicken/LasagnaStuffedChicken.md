# Lasagna Stuffed Chicken

Lasagna Stuffed Chicken

## Ingredients
- 2 – 9.1 ounce raw skinless chicken breast (2 leaners)
- 2/3 Cup part skim ricotta cheese (2/3 lean)
- 1 egg (1/3 lean)
- 2 Teaspoons Italian seasoning (4 condiments)
- 2 clove garlic (2 condiments)
- ½ Teaspoon salt (divided) (2 condiments)
- 1 Cup reduced fat mozzarella cheese (1 lean)
- 1 Cup low carb marinara sauce (4 greens)
- Garnish with chopped parsley (optional)

## Instructions
1. Butterfly chicken breasts and place into a lightly greased baking dish.
2. In a small mixing bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, egg, 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, garlic, salt, and 1 cup mozzarella cheese (leaving just a little aside for step #4).
3. Spoon about ¼ cup of sauce onto one half of each chicken breast. (leave just a little bit of sauce aside for the next step) Spread ricotta mixture on top of the sauce and fold chicken breasts over to close.
4. Drizzle remaining marinara sauce over chicken. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with remaining Italian seasoning and season with salt.
5. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 25-30 minutes, until chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
(you will then need to take the folded chicken breasts and slice in ½ so this makes 4 servings)
