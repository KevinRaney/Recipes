Chicken Parmesan

Yield: 2 Servings

Per serving:
1 Leaner
3 Condiments
1 Healthy Fat

Ingredients:
18 oz boneless chicken breasts
1/4 cup reduced-fat parmesan
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp garlic salt or 1/8 tsp salt
1/8 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp olive oil or 2 tbsp light
butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°
I like to pound my chicken breasts thin and then cut them lengthwise in half.
In a bowl, combine Parmesan, Italian seasonings, paprika, salt, and garlic powder. Line shallow baking pan with foil. Toss the oil or butter with chicken in cheese mixture. I put the cheese mixture in a Ziploc bag and then add the chicken.
Shake, shake, shake. Spread on prepared pan.
Bake for 30 minutes or until chicken is completely cooked.
