# Bunless Chicken BLTs

Note: To cook the chicken breasts ahead, you’ll only need to set aside about 15 minutes earlier in the week. When time allows, preheat your grill to medium-high heat or heat a large skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Place the chicken breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, and pound with a meat mallet or rolling pin (or heel of your hand) to ½-inch thickness. Don’t be tempted to skip this step. It’s the secret to ensuring the chicken cooks evenly and delivers a tender bite. Next, coat the chicken evenly with 1 Tbsp olive oil, ¼ tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper. Grill or sear chicken in a skillet 4 to 5 minutes per side or until done.
