# Sun-dried Tomato, Spinach, and Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast

Sun-dried Tomato, Spinach, and Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast

Ingredients:
18 ounces chicken breasts, boneless and skinless (2 Leaner)
1/2 cup sun dried tomato, drained and patted dry ~ water packed, cut into strips (2 Greens)
4 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese (1 Lean)
1 cup spinach (1 Green)
Non-stick pan spray

Italian Dressing:
1 tbsp Dijon Mustard (3 Condiments)
1 tbsp white wine vinegar (1/4 Condiment)
1 packet Splenda or Stevia (1 Condiment)
2 tsp olive oil (2 Healthy Fats)
1/2 tsp EACH Italian mixed herbs (see notes below) and red pepper flakes 
¼ tsp Salt (1 Condiment)
½ tsp pepper (1 Condiment)

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Whisk together the Italian Dressing ingredients in a bowl. It will be thicker than salad dressing.
Cut a pocket into each chicken breast, taking care not to cut all the way though.
Coat the chicken (inside and out) with the Italian Dressing.
Place chicken on work surface. Stuff with sun dried tomato, top with cheese then finish with spinach leaves. Just stuff in as much as you can.
Seal with toothpicks (just stick them in on the diagonal).
Heat oil in an ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add chicken and cook for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until golden.
Transfer to oven and cook for 15 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly and chicken is cooked through. Rest for 3 minutes before serving, drizzled with the juices in the skillet.

Recipe Notes
1. Use whatever dried herbs you have - thyme, oregano, parsley, basil.
2. Typically, a 6oz/180g chicken breast (which is a small chicken breast) will take 25 minutes to roast at 180C/350F. This recipe takes less time to roast because: a) it is started on the stove; and b) because the breast is stuffed, it cooks a bit from the inside because the stuffing is not as dense.
