# Turkey Spaghetti Squash Bake

Turkey Spaghetti Squash Bake

Yield:
2 servings

Ingredients:
3 cups cooked roasted spaghetti squash
1 ½ pound ground turkey
½ cup green spring onion, sliced
1 clove garlic
1/2 cup bell pepper (green would be ideal)
2 cups low sodium canned diced tomato
1 1/2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
1/4 cup chicken broth
1 tsp red pepper flakes
5-6 basil leaves
¼ teaspoon Sea salt
1 teaspoon oregano
2 tablespoons Parmesan Cheese
¾ cup low-fat Italian Blend Cheese

Directions:
Sauce:
In a large skillet or pot over medium heat, scramble fry the turkey until almost done. Season with 1 tsp of the chili powder.
Add onion and bell pepper until onion is translucent. Add garlic cook until fragrant.
Add the tomato and spices. I noticed at this point the sauce was too thick and didn't look right so I added some chicken broth.
Simmer on low until spaghetti squash is cooked (about an hour). The longer is simmering, the better the sauce.

Assemble:
Once the sauce is cooking to your liking and the squash is out of the oven, scoop the sauce onto the squash. It will fill the crater that you have made from scooping the seeds out. Pile it high.
Bake at 400 for 20 minutes.
Add cheeses and bake for another 10 - 15 minutes, or until cheese is golden brown.
Let cool and enjoy!
