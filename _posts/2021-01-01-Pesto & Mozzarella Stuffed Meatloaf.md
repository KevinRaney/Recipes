# Pesto & Mozzarella Stuffed Meatloaf

Pesto & Mozzarella Stuffed Meatloaf

Servings 6 servings
1 lean, 1 1/3 greens, 1 condiment, & 1 healthy fat

Ingredients:
• 2 lb. ground turkey
• 2 eggs
• 1 t. basil dried
• 1 t. oregano dried
• 1 t. salt
• 1/2 t. garlic powder
• 1 t. Italian seasoning
• 8 oz. mozzarella cut into 1-inch strips
• 1/4 cup pesto
• 1 c. sugar free spaghetti sauce

DIrections:
1 Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2 In a large bowl combine turkey, egg, basil, oregano, salt, and garlic powder.
3 Combine mixture with a spoon, and then by hand, until it is well incorporated.
4 Spread mixture on a large piece of parchment paper about 1inch thick.
5 Place strips of mozzarella along the edge of the meat mixture, leaving 1 inch on all sides uncovered by the mozzarella.
6 Spread pesto over mozzarella evenly.
7 Use parchment to roll the meat into a loaf. Transfer into a 13 x 9 inch baking dish. Very carefully, flip your meatloaf onto the baking dish, using the wax/parchment paper to help you release it from the pan.
8 Reshape the sides of the meatloaf and make sure all mozzarella is covered by the meat mixture.
9 Bake, uncovered, for 50-55 minutes in your preheated oven. During the last 10-15 minutes, pour spaghetti sauce on top of the meatloaf and continue baking, uncovered.
