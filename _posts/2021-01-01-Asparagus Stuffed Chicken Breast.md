## Ingredients
* 4 Skinless boneless chicken breasts about 1 1/2 lb. 
* 1 Pkg Italian seasoning mix 
* 1 Tsp Garlic Powder 
* 1 Tsp Smoked Paprika
* Sea salt and pepper 
* 12 Asparagus stalks end trimmed 
* 1 oz sun dried tomatoes
* 4 slices Mozzarella Cheese 
* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil 
* 1 skillet that you can move from the top of the stove to the oven.

## Directions
1. Preheat your oven to 400 F.

1. Start cutting each chicken breast lengthwise to create the pockets. Be careful not to cut all the way through. 

1. Place the chicken on a clean chopping board and sprinkle with Italian seasoning (I also sprinkle inside the pocket of the chicken), garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper.

1. Add 3 sprigs of asparagus and a couple of pieces of sun-dried tomatoes to a mozzarella slice, then roll it to hold them inside. Stuff the chicken breasts with it.
2. Close the pocket with a toothpick. 

1. Heat oil in skillet.Add the chicken to the skillet and sear it until nicely golden brown about 3-5 minutes per side. Move the skillet to the oven and bake the chicken for 15-20 minutes, or until thorough.
