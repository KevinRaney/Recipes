1 ½ Condiments

Ingredients: 
2 Cups part skim ricotta cheese
½ Cup reduced parmesan cheese
1 egg
¼ Teaspoon basil
¼ Teaspoon oregano
½ Teaspoon nutmeg
1 Cup spinach
2 Cups mini peppers
1 ½ Cup marinara sauce

Directions: 
Preheat oven to 375. In a bowl, mix cheeses, egg, spices and 1/2 of the spinach. Pour half of the marinara sauce into a 9×13 pan. Dot with remaining spinach. Cut the tops off the mini peppers and remove the veins and seeds. Fill with cheese mixture and place in the pan on top of the marinara sauce. Pour remaining 1/2 jar of sauce over the peppers and sprinkle with mozzarella. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes, or until peppers begin to soften. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until the cheese is browned and crisped around the edges.
