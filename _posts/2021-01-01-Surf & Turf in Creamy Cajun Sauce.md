# Surf & Turf in Creamy Cajun Sauce

## Ingredients 
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 5 ounces steak
* 7 ounces shrimp
* 10.5 ounces cauliflower
* 1/2 tbsp butter 
* 1/4 cup veg broth
* 1 cup almond milk
* 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 clove garlic
* 2 TBSP reduced fat parmesan cheese
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* Sprinkle parsley 

## Directions
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the steaks and sear until lightly browned on both sides and cooked to the desired level of doneness, before setting aside.
2. Reduce the heat to medium, add the butter and let it melt before adding the shrimp and cooking until just pink on both sides, about 1-2 minutes per side, and set aside.
3. In a separate small pot, add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about a minute.
4. Add the vegetable broth and deglaze the pan by scraping up any brown bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon as the broth sizzles.
5. Add the almond milk, mix in the dijon mustard and cajun seasoning, bring to a low boil and let simmer for a minute.
6. Mix in the cheese and let it melt into the sauce.
7. Mix in the lemon juice, parsley and shrimp then set aside. 
8. Place cauliflower florets (uncooked) into blender or food processor. Once riced, add to frying pan and steam with a small amount of water. 
9. Plate the rice then add steak and creamy shrimp sauce and serve!

Serves 2, per serving: 1 lean, 3 green, 3 condiments, .5 HF (for the shrimp)
