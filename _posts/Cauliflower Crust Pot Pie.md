Makes 4 servings
Each serving provides:
1 leaner protein
3 green
3 condiments

All ingredients:
4 cups Cauliflower
3 tbsp reduced fat Parmesan cheese
1 Egg
1/2 cup cooked leeks
1 1/2 cups Chicken broth
1/4 cup Almond milk, unsweetened
1.5 cup Mixed vegetables (use broccoli/cauliflower mix), frozen
24 oz Chicken, cooked
1 tsp Onion powder
1/2 tsp Black pepper
1/4 tsp Salt
2 tbsp almond flour

Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rice the cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until you achieve a rice-like consistency. Transfer cauliflower "rice" to a bowl and microwave for 5 minutes. Set aside and allow cauliflower to cool for approx 10 min.
Add the cauliflower rice to a cheesecloth and squeeze out as much of the juice from the cauliflower as possible. Once you have done a round with the cheesecloth. Repeat with another dry cheesecloth to ensure you have removed a majority of the liquid.
Add the dried cauliflower rice to a bowl with the egg, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Using your hands, combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Spray a large muffin pan or 4 ramekins and gently press the cauliflower mixture to the sides, creating a cauliflower bowl. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the centers are dry and the edges are golden brown.
While the cauliflower bases are in the oven, spray a medium saucepan with cooking spray and saute the leeks on high heat until slightly tender. Reduce heat to medium and add the chicken broth, almond milk, mixed vegetables, onion powder, salt and black pepper. Stir and cover for approx 5-8 minutes or until frozen vegetables are soft.
Mix the almond flour with the water to make a slurry and add to the sauce with the cooked chicken. Stir in the almond flour mixture and increase heat to high and cook until sauce begins to boil. Remove from heat.
Fill each cauliflower base with the pot pie filling and serve!
