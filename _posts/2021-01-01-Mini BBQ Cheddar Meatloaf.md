# Mini BBQ Cheddar Meatloaf

Mini BBQ Cheddar Meatloaf

Makes 5 servings

Per serving
1 lean
½ of 1 green 
3 condiments

Ingredients:
1 cup green spring onion cut in thin slices
10 sprays non-stick pan spray
¼ tsp Salt
½ tsp Pepper
1 1/2 pounds Ground Beef
1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder
1 Egg, whisked
1/4 cup + 4 tablespoons sugar-free BBQ Sauce (divided)
4 ounces Cheddar Cheese, cut into 1/4″ cubes

Directions:
Over medium heat, the non-stick spray in a large skillet. Cut the onion into thin slices and add the onions to the pan. Sprinkle the onions with salt and pepper and stir. Cook the onions, stirring every couple of minutes, until the onions are caramelized. Turn the heat down if you notice the onions are burning. Once caramelized, set the onions aside to slightly cool.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Prepare a large baking sheet by lining it with foil.
In a large bowl combine the ground beef, egg, 4 tablespoons BBQ sauce, cheese cubes, caramelized onions, and a dash of salt and pepper. Mix together just until combined.
Divide the mixture into 5 equal-sized portions and form them into mini-meatloaves. Place each one of the foil lined baking sheet. Spread 1-2 tablespoons of BBQ sauce over the top of each loaf and then bake for 20 minutes, or until no longer pink the center. (I spread the last BBQ Sauce after it has cooked.)
