Per serving
1 Lean protein
2 ½ vegetables 
1 ½ condiments

Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground beef
1 large head of cauliflower 
2 tbsp. almond flour
1 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 1/2 cups 2 % cheddar cheese, grated (divided)
½ tsp seasoning salt

Directions: 
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef until browned. Drain any excess fat.
Cut the cauliflower into florets, and steam them for about 5 minutes, until tender on the outside but still crisp in the middle.

In a saucepan, whisk the milk and almond flour together until smooth, and the mixture comes to a boil, then stir in 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Add seasoning salt, to taste.

Combine beef, cauliflower, and cheese sauce. Taste and add another pinch of seasoning salt, if desired.

Pour mixture into a casserole dish, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese.
Bake at 350 F for 20 minutes.
