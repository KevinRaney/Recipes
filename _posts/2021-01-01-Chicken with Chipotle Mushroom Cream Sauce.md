# Chicken with Chipotle Mushroom Cream Sauce

Chicken with Chipotle Mushroom Cream Sauce

Ingredients:
18 oz Raw Chicken Breasts - should yield 12 oz cooked (2 Leaner)
1/4 tsp Salt or garlic salt (1 Condiment)
1/8 tsp Pepper (1/4 Condiment)
1 tsp olive oil (1 Healthy Fat)

For the Sauce:
1 tsp olive oil (1 healthy fat)
1 1/4 Cup (3.8 oz) Mushrooms (2 1/2 Greens)
1/4 cup (.88 oz) scallion, thinly sliced (1/2 green)
1/2 cup lower-sodium chicken broth (1/2 Condiment)
2 wedges Light Queso & Chipotle Laughing Cow cheese (2 condiments)
1/4 tsp dried rosemary (1/4 Condiment)

Directions:
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and keep warm with foil tent.

Add 1 tsp to a pan and add the mushrooms, scallions and a splash of the broth to the skillet. Cook over medium heat, tossing frequently, until the mushrooms have wilted, about 3 minutes.

Add the remaining broth, light cheese wedges, rosemary and dash of salt. Stir until the cheese melts, about 1 minute.
Return the chicken to the pan and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through and still juicy, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Divide the chicken and sauce evenly among two plates.
