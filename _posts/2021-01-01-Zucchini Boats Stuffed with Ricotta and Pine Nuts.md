Zucchini Boats Stuffed with Ricotta and Pine Nuts

Makes 4 servings
Per serving
½ Protein serving
3 vegetables
3 condiments
¾ fat serving

4 medium zucchini, firm and unblemished – total weight 2 1/3 pounds
½ lb low fat ricotta cheese
4 Tbsp Parmesan cheese, shredded. Set aside 2 Tbsp for topping
1 Tbsp olive oil plus extra for drizzling
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tsp lemon juice, freshly squeezed
10 basil leaves, washed and patted dry, chopped. Reserve 2 Tb. for topping
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
4 Tbsp pine nuts (reserve half for topping)
1/8 tsp Salt
¼ tsp ground pepper

Directions
Wash zucchini and leave whole and untrimmed.
Place zucchini in a large pot of boiling, salted water and cook uncovered for 5 minutes. Do not overcook. They should be just barely tender to the fork.
Remove zucchini from water and place on dishtowel to cool. Pat dry.
Cut each zucchini in half lengthwise, trimming off the tip (I leave the round end but you chose).
With a melon baller, gently scrape out the flesh of each zucchini, leaving enough in the shell so that it can support the filling. Reserve scooped out flesh for another use or discard.
Pat each zucchini boat inside and out, with paper towels, to absorb as much moisture as possible.
Choose a large rectangular Pyrex pan that is large enough to hold all zucchini in one layer. Spray pan with canola oil. Place zucchini halves in pan with cavity side up. Set aside.
In a mixing bowl, place ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, lemon juice and chopped basil. Mix until combined and set aside.
In a small non-stick pan, toss pine nuts to brown. (Do not add oil to pan). Remove and add to cheese mixture.
In the same pan add a few drops of oil and sauté chopped garlic for 1-2 minutes. Do not brown. Add to cheese mixture. Season mixture with salt and pepper.
Using a teaspoon, carefully fill the zucchini boats with cheese mixture and top with reserved shredded cheese, basil leaves and pine nuts.
Bake at 350 degrees F on center rack, 20 minutes, until just golden.
