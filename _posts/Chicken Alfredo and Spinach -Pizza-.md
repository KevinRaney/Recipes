Chicken Alfredo and Spinach "Pizza"

Yield:
1 Serving

Per serving:
1 Lean
3 Greens
2 Condiments
1 Healthy Fat

Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup or 100 grams grated raw cauliflower
1/4 cup egg beaters
1/4 cup Reduced Fat 2% Mozzarella cheese

Toppings:
2.25 oz chicken, cooked and chopped
1/4 cup Reduced Fat 2% Mozzarella Cheese
1/2 cup spinach, cooked, drained, and chopped
2 tbsp reduced-fat feta cheese

Alfredo Sauce:
2 Light Garlic and Herb Cheese Wedges
2 tbsp unsweetened almond milk
1 tbsp Reduced Fat Parmesan, grated
1/4 tsp Molly McButter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place parchment paper on a cookie sheet and spray lightly with cooking spray. Combine grated cauliflower, egg beaters, and 1/4 cup cheese until mixed completely. Spoon mixture on prepared pan with parchment paper. Use the back of a spoon to thin out the mixture and form a circle about the size of a dinner plate without the rim. Bake for 30 minutes. Flip the crust over and bake an additional 10 minutes. Oven times may vary. Set aside.

Prepare Alfredo sauce by combining all ingredients for the sauce in a very small saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring to a boil and stir constantly until sauce is bubbly and thickened. Remove from heat and stir in chicken. Set aside. Top the crust with cooked spinach. Then spread chicken mixture over the spinach. Top with 1/4 cup mozzarella and sprinkle feta cheese on top. Broil until cheese is melted.
